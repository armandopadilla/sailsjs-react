# sailsjs-react

## SailsJS + React base project

### Quick Notes
I started off using the great and easy to follow video resource below but ran into an issue outlined here, https://github.com/reactjs/express-react-views/issues/71. Using the fix outlined by skatpgusskat, I was able to get it working.  Unfortunately had the issue below creep up.

### Issues
1.  Currently the initial load takes a very long time, subsequent page refreshes are quick.

### References
1.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaGNKRKvB-c&feature=youtu.be&a - Got me started on the right footing.
